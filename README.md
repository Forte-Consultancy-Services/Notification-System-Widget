# Notification System Widget :loudspeaker: 
This is a notification system widget to provide particular information to a user and obtain response from that user, based on the type of user and the type of notification used in the sharing economy. The current version (created using React.js) enables organizations to adapt the widget for their purpose and assumptions. It acts as a web API to React Native (iOS and Android).
