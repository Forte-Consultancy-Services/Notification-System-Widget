4) Work on the improvement or fixture of each issue on a separate branch (label branch using issue number) and [send a pull request](https://github.com/Forte-Consultancy-Services/Notification-System-Widget/pulls) for review, comparing a new head branch of modifications with the base branch by selecting the associated issue number as the new head branch with the pull request. The issue number selected will be the title of the pull request. The commit message will contain reference to the issue number, the changes made, and the test plan (if any). The pull request will be labelled as **_high priority for easy fixes_**, **_medium priority for middle-of-the-road fixes_**, and **_low priorty for difficult fixes_**.

Pull request reviews are carried out in order of priority, with those labelled as **_high priority (easy fix)_** being reviewed before the **_medium priority (middle-of-the-road fix)_** and the **_low priority (difficult fix)_** pull requests.
